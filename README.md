There is currently no public data source for daily active MLB rosters. This repo provides a script to pull the current daily active rosters from ESPN team roster pages and is scheduled in order to compile a data source for historical active rosters by day.

> The file is located at data/DailyMLBRosters.csv

The first available day of rosters is 07/04/2022.
